## Use Case

One click from CRM to a fully personalized proposal. The agent pulls prospect data and conversation history, then generates a complete commercial proposal: executive summary, problem understanding, recommended solution, methodology, deliverables, timeline, pricing, ROI estimate, relevant case studies, and next steps.

## The Flow

Deal in CRM triggers → Pull prospect data (sector, need, budget, timeline) → Analyze email/call history → Match to relevant case studies → Generate: executive summary + problem framing + solution + methodology + deliverables + timeline + pricing + ROI + next steps → Format as branded PDF → Send for internal review → Email to prospect

## Real Client Example

A consulting agency sending 25 proposals/month. Before: 150h of commercial effort. After: 8h of review only. Reallocation of 140h to prospecting = +40 additional meetings = +8 new clients/quarter.
