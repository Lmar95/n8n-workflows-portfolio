## Use Case

From just an email or company name, automatically enrich leads with 30+ data points: full name, role, phone, LinkedIn, company size, revenue, headcount, funding history, growth signals, intent signals, and additional decision-makers.

## The Flow

Lead enters CRM → Trigger enrichment → Clay waterfall: Dropcontact → Hunter.io → Clearbit → BuiltWith → LinkedIn → Consolidate 30+ fields → Score completeness → Push enriched record to CRM → Slack notify sales rep

## Real Client Example

A 5-person sales team receiving 200 leads/week. Before: 8h/person of manual research. After: auto-enrichment in 2 min/lead. Gain: 40h/week reallocated to prospecting = +25 meetings/week.
