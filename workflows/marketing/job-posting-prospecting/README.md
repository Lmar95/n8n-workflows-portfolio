## Use Case

Scrape job boards (LinkedIn Jobs, Welcome to the Jungle, Indeed) to detect companies hiring in key roles — a strong growth signal. Enrich company data, find decision-makers, and launch personalized outreach mentioning the job posting as the trigger.

## The Flow

Apify scrape job boards daily → Filter by target job titles (Head of Sales, Head of Growth...) → Clay enrich company (revenue, headcount, funding) → Score vs ICP → Find decision maker + email → Lemlist sequence referencing the job posting as opener

## Real Client Example

A recruitment software vendor targeted companies posting 5+ simultaneous open positions. Opening line: 'I saw you're hiring 7 people this quarter — perfect timing to optimize your ATS.' Conversion rate to client: 18% of booked meetings.
