## Use Case

Provide your offer, ICP, benefits, and competitors. The agent analyzes top-performing landing pages in your sector, then generates 3 complete page variants using AIDA, PAS, and Before-After-Bridge frameworks — including headlines, subheads, benefit sections, testimonial structures, CTAs, FAQs, and objection handling.

## The Flow

Input: offer + ICP + benefits + competitors → Apify scrape top competitor landing pages → Analyze structure + copy patterns → Generate 3 full variants (AIDA / PAS / Before-After-Bridge) → Each with: headline, subheads, benefits, CTA, FAQ, objections → Export to Google Docs for review

## Real Client Example

A B2B SaaS tested 3 landing page variants from this workflow. The Problem-Solution version converted at 4.2% vs 1.8% original. At 10K visitors/month: +240 leads = +72K€ additional pipeline.
