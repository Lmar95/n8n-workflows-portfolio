## The Flow

Sales Navigator monitor signals (job changes, posts, anniversaries) → Phantombuster extract profiles → Clay enrich (email, phone, company data) → Score relevance vs ICP → Personalize message based on specific signal → Lemlist send sequence (connection + 3-4 follow-ups) → CRM log all activity
